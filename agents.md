# Agents Module â€” ZEN AI Pioneer / Vanguard Track
### Module 3: AI Interaction & Autonomy
This file instructs Codex to generate a complete, hands-on AI literacy course that teaches learners to **deploy**, **embed**, and **integrate** their own AI creations.  
By the end of this module, every learner will have:

- A live **Hugging Face Space** they personally launched.  
- A **custom Google Site** integrated with that Space.  
- Custom-coded **HTML/JS widgets** and generated images.  
- Two advanced exercises tested in the course itself.
